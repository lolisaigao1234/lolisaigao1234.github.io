            Opened the door, you walked into the village. 
            Everyone was thankful for what you have done 
            for them. You are praised amongst all the 
            previous bravery heroes that arrived to the village. 
            You have been elected to become the new Duke to reign
            this area. The witch nominated herself to become your 
            maid, as the house is a bit huge for just one person 
            to live.

            Its now night, this is what you saw after you traverse
            the forest. Isn't that beautiful?
        </p>
        <p>
            You met a witch besides the tree. Would you like to talk to her?
        </p>
        <p> Click on the button if you like to talk to her. </p>
        <button onclick="TalkToWitch()">Talk to the Witch</button>
        <p> Or, you could continue traverse the forest. </p>

        <p>
            You choose to talk to the witch. However, she casted a spell
            on you without a doubt. Would you like to fight back?
        </p>
        <p> Click on the button if you choose to fight the witch. </p>
        <button onclick="FightTheWitch()">Fight the witch</button>
        <p> 
            Or you could run away from her and continue exploring the forest.
        </p>
        <a href="dungeon.html">Run away</a>

        <div id="fightTheWitch" style="display: none;">
            <p> 
                Just before she is going to caste another spell on you, 
                you heard a sound from far away. You do not know who was it.
                However, the voice told you that if you have not picked up
                the book in the bedroom of the house, go back and pick it up. 
            </p>
            <a href="bedroom.html">Teleport back to the bedroom</a>
            <p> 
                If you had already picked it up, then it is up to you to decide 
                what to do with that book. 
            </p>
            <p> Would you like to show the book to the witch? </p>
            <button onclick="ShowBookToWitch()">Show the book to the witch</button>
            <p> If not, choose the link below. </p>
            <a href="deathWitchkill.html">Choose not to show the book to the witch.</a>
            <hr>
            <div id="showBookToWitch" style="display: none;">
                <p> 
                    The witch saw the book you held in hand, and she was really
                    surprised why you have that book. She stopped the spell and
                    teleported you and herself to a new place.

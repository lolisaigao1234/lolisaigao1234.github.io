            You have entered the room, and you saw the duke 
            sitting on the chair with a gigantic sword on his hand 
            waiting for you to come.  
        </p>
        <p> 
            "It has been a few days after my arrival to here, and no one
            like you had come to this place. I shall give you my respect 
            of your attempt. "
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nonetheless, you shall not pass further. If you want to earn 
            back the happiness and joy for the villagers, then fight me."
        </p>

            The Duke Bob picked up the sword, and you take out the spellbook
            and prepared ready for the fight. 
        </p>

            You are hearing the sound of the charge of a knight. 
            It was the knight that you saw before came and help you. 
        </p>
        <p>"Hope that I am on time," the knight smirked and said. </p>
        <p>"Now is two to one, lets get to go!"</p>

            Three people stood at where they were, all of them feared about 
            losing the fight. But in a sudden, the Duke dashed towards you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Duke plucked the torch from your grasp. The Duke flung the 
            torch at the face of the knight. The knight dodged the torch 
            with a roll on the ground. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To gain a brief respite, you opened the spellbook, and you 
            instantly noticed a spell that could push the Duke away for 
            several seconds. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You cast that spell just before Duke's sword hit you, and he 
            was pushed away by you just on time. The knight had get up using
            his sword. He charged towards the Duke as the Duke was flying 
            back without his control. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Duke deflected the sword with his sword in a cascade of sparks.
            "Nice try, but not this time." The Duke then whirled his sword 
            in a flashing arc, targeting the knight without a doubt. The 
            knight flipped back using his sword and panted severely. 
            "Oof, that was close enough."

            You have entered the room, and you saw the duke 
            sitting on the chair with a gigantic sword on his hand 
            waiting for you to come.  
        </p>
        <p> 
            "It has been a few days after my arrival to here, and no one
            like you had come to this place. I shall give you my respect 
            of your attempt. "
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nonetheless, you shall not pass further. If you want to earn 
            back the happiness and joy for the villagers, then fight me."
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            The Duke Bob picked up the sword, and you take out the spellbook
            and prepared ready for the fight. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            You are hearing the sound of the charge of a knight. 
            It was the knight that you saw before came and help you. 
        </p>
        <p>"Hope that I am on time," the knight smirked and said. </p>
        <p>"Now is two to one, lets get to go!"</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>
            Three people stood at where they were, all of them feared about 
            losing the fight. But in a sudden, the Duke dashed towards you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Duke plucked the torch from your grasp. The Duke flung the 
            torch at the face of the knight. The knight dodged the torch 
            with a roll on the ground. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To gain a brief respite, you opened the spellbook, and you 
            instantly noticed a spell that could push the Duke away for 
            several seconds. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You cast that spell just before Duke's sword hit you, and he 
            was pushed away by you just on time. The knight had get up using
            his sword. He charged towards the Duke as the Duke was flying 
            back without his control. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Duke deflected the sword with his sword in a cascade of sparks.
            "Nice try, but not this time." The Duke then whirled his sword 
            in a flashing arc, targeting the knight without a doubt. The 
            knight flipped back using his sword and panted severely. 
            "Oof, that was close enough."
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>
            You know that these attacks will not hurt the Duke, and your 
            and the knight's stamina was plummeting without a doubt. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, you find out the knife that you take from the drawer
            back in the bedroom. The knife now is glowing in a abnormal 
            manner. This knife may be able to accomplish the quest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The knight also saw the glowing knife, and he understood
            what to do to earn you time to stab that thing into the 
            Duke's body. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a blink of an eye, the knight cast himself a sprint spell
            and increased his moving speed. He then flashed beside the Duke, 
            and swung the sword he had on his hand to get the attention from 
            the Duke. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Another nice try, but it won't work", the Duke said. 
            "Who knows", said the knight with a burst of laugh, as he saw 
            that you have approached the back of the Duke.  
        </p>
        <p>
            While the Duke was distracted by the knight, you sneaked behind
            the Duke, and it is time to stab that magistic knife into the 
            Duke's body. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>
            "Ahhhhhh", the Duke roared with pain as the knife stabbed into
            his body. The knight and you laughed with the sense of 
            achievement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The instrument dropped from his hands. His arms appeared to be 
            fastened to his sides. He kneeled down with pain, and his feet 
            and back had trembled with great pain. Blood was everywhere. 
            The knife glowed brighter as it sucked in more blood of the Duke. 
            The Duke could not even make a sound, as the tremendous amount
            of pain crushed him and his nerves. The knife, after a while, 
            dropped from his back, and stopped glowing. The Duke had become 
            a corpse. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All this happened in a sudden, and so short in tim that only 
            astonishment was in the knight's head. Long before anyone could
            do anything to save the Duke, the Duke had become a corpse. 
            His body had melted down due to the power of the magistic knife,
            what is left is his skull, with nothing inside. You had finished
            the quest and take down the tyrant.  
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            <strong>
                However, the knight started laughing after the Duke was dead.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, after so many years, after such a long wait, after such 
            a help from you, I had my revenge on this person. " The knight 
            said all of these with full strength, you can even hear the 
            quiver in his voice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Now I should reveal my true identity. I am the former 
                Duke that was assassinated by this obnoxious brave man. 
                I am the justice. I raised the tax on my own behave, 
                and the villagers should be thankful for me to give them
                so long time for a pleasant life.  
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>
                "Now I have shared my secret, so you could not live."
           </strong>
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>
            The knight swung his sword so quick that you could not dodge.

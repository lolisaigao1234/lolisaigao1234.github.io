            Once upon a time, there was a duke that is really nice to the
            people at his land. He had given food to the poor people in 
            the land. He had shared his house with travellers who was eagered
            to find a place to live. He had done many respectful stuff 
            that many others could not image.

            However, one day, without much indication, he acted like another
            person that everyone could not believe. He raised the tax at
            his territory. He built up an huge house for himself and his maids
            to live, which I believe you have an idea what it is. Everyone is 
            desparate and curious that where is their beloved duke.

            Months passed, the people at his land could not bear the torture
            and the high tax that the duke planted on them. The major at the 
            little village decided to recruit someone to take down the duke
            and set the villagers free.

            The hero, the brave man, the spectacular whose name is Bob
            came and decided to take the quest. He sneaked in the house
            where the duke lives. He silently assassinated the duke for 
            justice.

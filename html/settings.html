            Once upon a time, there was a duke that is really nice to the
            people at his land. He had given food to the poor people in 
            the land. He had shared his house with travellers who was eagered
            to find a place to live. He had done many respectful stuff 
            that many others could not image.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, one day, without much indication, he acted like another
            person that everyone could not believe. He raised the tax at
            his territory. He built up an huge house for himself and his maids
            to live, which I believe you have an idea what it is. Everyone is 
            desparate and curious that where is their beloved duke. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Months passed, the people at his land could not bear the torture
            and the high tax that the duke planted on them. The major at the 
            little village decided to recruit someone to take down the duke
            and set the villagers free. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The hero, the brave man, the spectacular whose name is Bob
            came and decided to take the quest. He sneaked in the house
            where the duke lives. He silently assassinated the duke for 
            justice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone thought that their miserable life will end from now on, 
            which is what happened in the early stage. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, the happy life for the villagers only lasted for 
            a few weeks. The hero Bob was elected to become the new duke 
            to reign this area, and he, same as the last Duke, decided to 
            raise taxes on the villagers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The villagers regreted that they started the quest, as they 
            actually did not get what they want. They just got another
            tyrant.
        </p>
        <p>
            The good news is that Bob, a few days ago, left the house and 
            went into a dungeon for some secret stuff. He even left 
            everything back in the house. Thus, my request to you, my
            traveller, is to kill Bob and give the villagers true peace
            and happiness.

            You walked out the room, and you find out that 
            the knight you ignored is standing just outside 
            the room. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Is the Duke dead? Is he?!?
            </strong>
            The knight screamed at you and trying to confirm 
            that the Duke was dead. You nodded your head 
            and confirmed that the Duke was dead. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The knight celebrated with his whole soul and body. 
            He jumped up and down, cheering "hooray" with some 
            huge laughs. After several minutes, you noticed that 
            he gradually stopped what he was doing. The knight 
            suddenly started speaking. 
        </p>

        <p>
            "Yes, after so many years, after such a long wait, after such 
            a help from you, I had my revenge on this person. " The knight 
            said all of these with full strength, you can even hear the 
            quiver in his voice. 
        </p>

            <strong>
                Now I should reveal my true identity. I am the former 
                Duke that was assassinated by this obnoxious brave man. 
                I am the justice. I raised the tax on my own behave, 
                and the villagers should be thankful for me to give them
                so long time for a pleasant life.  
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>
                "I have shared my secret, so you could not live."
           </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The knight swung his sword so quick that you could not dodge.

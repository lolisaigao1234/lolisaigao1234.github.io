        <p> Just before she is going to caste another spell on you, 
            you heard a sound from far away. You do not know who was it.
            However, the voice told you that if you have not picked up
            the book in the master room of the house, go back and pick it up. 
        </p>
        <a href="masterRoom.html">Teleport back to the master room</a>
        <p> 
            If you had already picked it up, then it is up to you to decide 
            what to do with that book.

        <p> The witch saw the book you held in hand, and she was really
            surprised why you have that book. She stopped the spell
            teleported you and herself to a new place.

            Now you are in the dungeon. You picked up a torch beside and 
            slowly walked inside. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The dungeon was extraordinary dark, and you could not find
            any hint of creatures or life in the dungeon. You slowly walked 
            down the tunnel inside the dungeon.
        </p>
        <p>
            You saw a treasure box, would you like to open it?

            You walked pass the treasure box, and keep on walking.

            Suddenly, you heard a sound from deep inside the dungeon, 
            you can tell that its a moaning sound from a human. 
            Also, you noticed that there was another road beside the 
            one with the sound coming out. 
            Would you like to go to the sound source and take a look?
            Or, would you like to go and explore the other road?

            You hold the torch in front of you, and slowly walked down the 
            road to take a look. Eventually, you walked down and saw there 
            was a man moaning. He asked that if you could give him a med kit
            to heal him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Choose to give him the med kit if you have it.

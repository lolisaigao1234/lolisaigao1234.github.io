            Now you are in the dungeon. You picked up a torch beside and 
            slowly walked inside.

            The dungeon was extraordinary dark, and you could not find
            any hint of creatures or life in the dungeon. You slowly walked 
            down the tunnel inside the dungeon.

            one with the sound coming out.

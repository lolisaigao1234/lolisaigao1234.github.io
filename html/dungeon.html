            You have traversed the forest. In front of you is a 
            dungeon. Would you like to go inside?
        </p>
        <p> Click on the button to explore the dungeon. </p>
        <button onclick="ExploreDungeon()">Explore the Dungeon</button>
        <p> Or click on the click to go back to the forest. </p>

    <div id="exploreDungeon" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            Now you are in the dungeon. You picked up a torch beside and 
            slowly walked inside. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The dungeon was extraordinary dark, and you could not find
            any hint of creatures or life in the dungeon. You slowly walked 
            down the tunnel inside the dungeon.
        </p>
        <p> You saw a treasure box, would you like to open it? </p>
        <p> Click on the button to ignore the treasure box and continue exploring.</p>
        <button onclick="IgnoreTreasureBox()">Ignore the treasure box</button>
        <p> Click on the link to open the treasure box. </p>

        <div id="ignoreTreasureBox" style="display: none;">
            <p>
                You walked pass the treasure box, and keep on walking. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly, you heard a sound from deep inside the dungeon, 
                you can tell that its a moaning sound from a human. 
                Also, you noticed that there was another road beside the 
                one with the sound coming out. 
                Would you like to go to the sound source and take a look?
                Or, would you like to go and explore the other road?
            </p>
            <p> Click on the button to take a look at the sound source. </p>
            <button onclick="LookSoundSource()">Take a look?</button>
            <p> Click on the link to explore the other road</p>

            <div id="lookSoundSource" style="display: none;">
                <p>
                    You hold the torch in front of you, and slowly walked down the 
                    road to take a look. Eventually, you walked down and saw there 
                    was a man moaning. He asked that if you could give him a med kit
                    to heal him. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choose to give him the med kit if you have it. 
                </p>
                <a href="newParter.html">Give him the med kit. </a>
                <p>
                    Continue reading if you choose not to give the med kit
                    or you do not have one. 
                </p>

                    <p>
                        You walked pass the moaning man, and there was a door to open. 
                        Would you like to open the door?

            The blog will be simple, and the blog will consist of 
            some basic concepts in the Theogony and the Olympic Gods 
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction of the Gods</h3>
        <p>
            In this section, I would like to discuss about the major
            Gods and Goddesses in the Iliad and some brief 
            discussion regarding asexual reproduction. 
        </p>
        <p> Let us talk about the major Gods and Goddesses first. </p>

        <h5>Chaos & Gaia & Tartarus & Eros</h5>
        <p>
            If we would discuss Hesiod's Theogony, we would start with the 
            initial four. The first beings after Chaos were the Gaia, 
            Tartarus and Eros. Chaos provides the beginning for creation. 
            So we can say that Chaos created the universe. Thus, the start
            of the genesis will be Chaos. Chaos, also represented the mass
            of the four basic elements - earth, air, fire, and water - from 
            which the university is created.

            Now turn our focus to Gaia. She was the representation of Earth,
            and fertility mother from Chaos. In the later stage, we would 
            discuss regarding the birth of Gaia with the topic of asexual 
            reproduction in Hesiod Theogony. Most importantly, Gaia was the 
            first deity who was recognized as female.

            Next, we would discuss Eros, who also was the descendant
            of the initial deity, Chaos. The deity represents the concept
            of <span class="emphasized">Love</span>, which will be essential in later stages.

            The blog will be simple, and the blog will consist of 
            some basic concepts in the Theogony and the Olympic Gods 
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction of the Gods</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, I would like to discuss about the major
            Gods and Goddesses in the Iliad and some brief 
            discussion regarding asexual reproduction. 
        </p>
        <p> Let us talk about the major Gods and Goddesses first. </p>

    <h3>Genesis - The Initial Deities</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Chaos & Gaia & Tartarus & Eros</h4>
        <p>
            If we would discuss Hesiod's Theogony, we would start with the 
            initial four. The first beings after Chaos were the Gaia, 
            Tartarus and Eros. Chaos provides the beginning for creation. 
            So we can say that Chaos created the universe. Thus, the start
            of the genesis will be Chaos. Chaos, also represented the mass
            of the four basic elements - earth, air, fire, and water - from 
            which the university is created. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now turn our focus to Gaia. She was the representation of Earth,
            and fertility mother from Chaos. In the later stage, we would 
            discuss regarding the birth of Gaia with the topic of asexual 
            reproduction in Hesiod Theogony. Most importantly, Gaia was the 
            first deity who was recognized as female. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we would discuss Eros, who also was the descendant
            of the initial deity, Chaos. The deity represents the concept
            of <span class="emphasized">Love</span>, which will be essential 
            in later stages. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Alas, we would look at Tartarus, who also was the descendant 
            of the initial deity, Chaos. The deity represents an inner part 
            of Earth, which placed very deep inside the Earth. The place was 
            designed to become the underworld of Earth, and served as a place 
            of punishment, which jails the individuals who commited severe 
            crimes or mistakes in the mythology. 
        </p>

        <h4>Uranus / Ouranos & Gaia </h4>
        <p> 
            Talking about Uranus, he was the deity that represents the sky,
            lightning and thunder of the Earth. He was the descendant of 
            mother Earth, thus produced by Gaia. Gaia had produced Uranus 
            by her own, which was an example of asexual reproduction. Later, 
            Uranus and Gaia had married and gave birth to the twelve titans and
            the three Cyclopes and three Hecatoncheires. The twelve Titans in 
            the future would mate with each other, which is another evidence
            of incest among the deities, had gave birth to some of the most 
            important deities in the Greco-Roman mythology. Among all the 
            titans, two of the most important ones were Rhea and Cronus/Kronos.
            Beside the eighteen deities listed above, Uranus had also gave birth 
            to another deity, Aphrodite, born from the Uranus' genital. The 
            castration of Uranus was done by their children, Kronos, who was 
            intructed by his mother, Gaia.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h4>Rhea & Kronos</h4>
        <p> 
            Two of the Uranus and Gaia's children, had decided to mate 
            themselves together, but forgot to take measures to prevent 
            conception. Thus, when Rhea was about to gave birth to their 
            children, Kronos decided to eat their Children up. Why Kronos
            decided to eat up their children was because his behavior back 
            in the castration of his father. Kronos was afraid that their 
            children will do something similar that he had done before. Thus, 
            to prevent something like this happen in the future, Kronos
            decided to fundamentally solve the problem, by devouring 
            their children. <br> Nonetheless, Zeus and his sibling were still
            born in this world as their mother, Rhea, ambushed the children 
            on the Crete island and lied to his husband by giving Kronos
            clothes to eat. Thus, the children, the six major deity in 
            Greco-Roman mythology named as Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, 
            Hades, Hestia, Demeter, were born without harm from their father. 
            Eventually, Kronos did face the same fate as his father that Kronos
            was overthrown by Zeus and his siblings.

    <h3>The Twelve Olympians</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Zeus & Hera</h4>
        <p>
            Zeus, god of storm and guardian of state and justice, after many 
            incidents, was elected as the leader between The Twelve Olympians.
            The most import attributes of the god were thunderbolts, 
            scepter and throne. The animal that represents Zeus was Eagle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hera, god of childbirth and marriage, also as the first wife,
            were another important deity in the mythology. The attributes 
            of the goddess were polos, veil and next to Zeus. The animal 
            that represents Hera was Cow and Peacock. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two of the Rhea and Kronos's children, had decided to mate 
            themselves together, where most of the stories in the Hesiod 
            Theogony revolved around these two. Zeus had fought with his 
            father, and the Giants and Typhoeus, and punished Prometheus 
            for stealing fire for human kind. He had also sent Pandora as 
            the punishment to the mortals, by giving Pandora a box that
            contains all the evil and hope. The human kind had opened the 
            box as Zeus planned, and thus the punishment is done.

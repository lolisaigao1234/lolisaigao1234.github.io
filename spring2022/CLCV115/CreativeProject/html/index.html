            The blog will be simple, and the blog will consist of 
            some basic concepts in the Theogony and the Olympic Gods 
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction of the Gods</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, I would like to discuss about the major
            Gods and Goddesses in the Iliad and some brief 
            discussion regarding asexual reproduction. 
        </p>
        <p> Let us talk about the major Gods and Goddesses first. </p>

    <h3>Genesis - The Initial Deities</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Chaos & Gaia & Tartarus & Eros</h4>

        <img src="../images/chaos.jpeg" width="128" height="205">
        <p>
            If we would discuss Hesiod's Theogony, we would start with the 
            initial four. The first beings after Chaos were the Gaia, 
            Tartarus and Eros. Chaos provides the beginning for creation. 
            So we can say that Chaos created the universe. Thus, the start
            of the genesis will be Chaos. Chaos, also represented the mass
            of the four basic elements - earth, air, fire, and water - from 
            which the university is created. 
        </p>
        <hr>

        <img src="../images/gaia.jpg" width="167" height="250">
        <p>
            Now turn our focus to Gaia. She was the representation of Earth,
            and fertility mother from Chaos. In the later stage, we would 
            discuss regarding the birth of Gaia with the topic of asexual 
            reproduction in Hesiod Theogony. Most importantly, Gaia was the 
            first deity who was recognized as female. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        
        <img src="../images/eros.jpeg" width="180" height="225">
        <p>
            Next, we would discuss Eros, who also was the descendant
            of the initial deity, Chaos. The deity represents the concept
            of <em>Love</em>, which will be essential 
            in later stages. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        
        <img src="../images/tartarus.jpeg" width="175" height="250">
        <p>
            Alas, we would look at Tartarus, who also was the descendant 
            of the initial deity, Chaos. The deity represents an inner part 
            of Earth, which placed very deep inside the Earth. The place was 
            designed to become the underworld of Earth, and served as a place 
            of punishment, which jails the individuals who commited severe 
            crimes or mistakes in the mythology. 
        </p>

        <h4>Uranus / Ouranos & Gaia </h4>
        <img src="../images/uranus.jpg" width="178" height="320">
        <p> 
            Talking about Uranus, he was the deity that represents the sky,
            lightning and thunder of the Earth. He was the descendant of 
            mother Earth, thus produced by Gaia. Gaia had produced Uranus 
            by her own, which was an example of asexual reproduction. Later, 
            Uranus and Gaia had married and gave birth to the twelve titans and
            the three Cyclopes and three Hecatoncheires. The twelve Titans in 
            the future would mate with each other, which is another evidence
            of incest among the deities, had gave birth to some of the most 
            important deities in the Greco-Roman mythology. Among all the 
            titans, two of the most important ones were Rhea and Cronus/Kronos.
            Beside the eighteen deities listed above, Uranus had also gave birth 
            to another deity, Aphrodite, born from the Uranus' genital. The 
            castration of Uranus was done by their children, Kronos, who was 
            intructed by his mother, Gaia.
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <div>
        <h4>Rhea & Kronos</h4>
        <p>Rhea</p>
        <img src="../images/rhea.jpeg" width="150" height="216">
        <p>Kronos</p>
        <p> 
            Two of the Uranus and Gaia's children, had decided to mate 
            themselves together, but forgot to take measures to prevent 
            conception. Thus, when Rhea was about to gave birth to their 
            children, Kronos decided to eat their Children up. Why Kronos
            decided to eat up their children was because his behavior back 
            in the castration of his father. Kronos was afraid that their 
            children will do something similar that he had done before. Thus, 
            to prevent something like this happen in the future, Kronos
            decided to fundamentally solve the problem, by devouring 
            their children. <br> Nonetheless, Zeus and his sibling were still
            born in this world as their mother, Rhea, ambushed the children 
            on the Crete island and lied to his husband by giving Kronos
            clothes to eat. Thus, the children, the six major deity in 
            Greco-Roman mythology named as Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, 
            Hades, Hestia, Demeter, were born without harm from their father. 
            Eventually, Kronos did face the same fate as his father that Kronos
            was overthrown by Zeus and his siblings.

    <h3>The Twelve Olympians</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Zeus & Hera</h4>
        <img src="../images/zeus.png" width="150" height="212">
        <p>
            Zeus, god of storm and guardian of state and justice, after many 
            incidents, was elected as the leader between The Twelve Olympians.
            The most import attributes of the god were thunderbolts, 
            scepter and throne. The animal that represents Zeus was Eagle.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <img src="../images/hera.png" width="150" height="207">
        <p>
            Hera, god of childbirth and marriage, also as the first wife,
            were another important deity in the mythology. The attributes 
            of the goddess were polos, veil and next to Zeus. The animal 
            that represents Hera was Cow and Peacock. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two of the Rhea and Kronos's children, had decided to mate 
            themselves together, where most of the stories in the Hesiod 
            Theogony revolved around these two. Zeus had fought with his 
            father, and the Giants and Typhoeus, and punished Prometheus 
            for stealing fire for human kind. He had also sent Pandora as 
            the punishment to the mortals, by giving Pandora a box that
            contains all the evil and hope. The human kind had opened the 
            box as Zeus planned, and thus the punishment is done.

    <h2>Parthenogenesis in Hesiod's Theogony</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Now we should talk about the Parthenogenesis inside Theogony. 
            We had already introduced some of the most important deities 
            that performed this behavior in the epic poetry, thus we can take a look
            at the incidents and elaborate this incident towards the gender 
            role during the ancient Greece. The practice reflected the 
            conflict and difference between genders and other factors 
            that we could still discuss at this date. The one example I will 
            be discussing is Hera. Initially, Hera used this behavior to 
            resist against his husband, Zeus. In the later stage, this 
            behavior actually backfired as this action enforced Zeus's reign 
            at the Olympics. The nature of this act in this circumstance 
            illustrated the gender difference and conflict which also illustrated
            the harmonic and stable relationship between deities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following content would contain many quotes from the second 
            sources I use, the source is linked below at the end of the 
            webpage. Now I would be discussing Hesiod Theogony and Hera.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the myths that we knew that described the ancienct Greece, 
            we would have noticed that much of which does not have women inside 
            the literature. Even if, the role of the women was neglected to a 
            large degree that they would play non-major characters inside the epic. 
            We can also tell this trend or custom by taking a look at the role 
            assignment of opera in ancient Greece. None of the female characters 
            were casted by females, rather male would cast the characters inside 
            the plays.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, one of the significance of Hesiod's Theogony according 
            to the author was the increased female participation in the myth
            and the behavior they did to give birth to their descendants. 
            As we know, for reproduction, we would need male and female to 
            accomplish the task. in the Hesiod's Theogony, we would observe 
            many examples that female individuals had reproduced by 
            theirselves. Both of these differences from norm showed a
            unparalleled relationship between the Theogony and real life back 
            in Greece at that time. Hesiod had used this method to distinguish
            ordinary human kinds and the deities. Note that the content inside
            the Theogony does not equal to support towards feminist in 
            today's content. Hesiod, had assigned the female deities various
            roles in the story. Hera was the example of resist against his 
            husband but in the end actually helped him to enforce his reign. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hera's asexual reproduction is where various expressions 
            converge. The main reason behind her anger was the child Athena, 
            who was born from Zeus's head. The situation was interesting as 
            we know Athena was also asexually reproduced by Zeus, where Zeus's 
            wife believed her husband cheated on her, decide to use the same
            method, parthenogenetic, to express her rage. Before Hera had 
            asexually reproduced Hephaestus, she had already reproduced several 
            children for Zeus, namely Hebe, Ares, and Eileithyia. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Further, the weight that was given on the children inside the 
            literature was noticeable. The first generation, or the normal 
            descendants who were borned with sexual intercourse between the 
            couple, had got nearly none descriptions inside the Theogony. 
            In constrast, we have Hephaestus, who was widely praised belong 
            the deities for his power of crafting and smithing. One
            nuance of the identity of Hephaestus in Iliad and Theogony is that
            Homer had acknowledged Hephaestus as the child of Zeus 
            <em>and</em> Hera. While, Hesiod woudl counter on that argument and 
            stated that Hephaestus was the child of Hera herself.

<section>
    <div>
        <!-- the p below should be deleted after final production-->
        <p>
            The blog will be simple, and the blog will consist of 
            some basic concepts in the Theogony and the Olympic Gods 
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction of the Gods</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, I would like to discuss about the major
            Gods and Goddesses in the Iliad and some brief 
            discussion regarding asexual reproduction. 
        </p>
        <p> Let us talk about the major Gods and Goddesses first. </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Genesis - The Initial Deities</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Chaos & Gaia & Tartarus & Eros</h4>

        <img src="../images/chaos.jpeg" width="128" height="205">
        <p>
            If we would discuss Hesiod's Theogony, we would start with the 
            initial four. The first beings after Chaos were the Gaia, 
            Tartarus and Eros. Chaos provides the beginning for creation. 
            So we can say that Chaos created the universe. Thus, the start
            of the genesis will be Chaos. Chaos, also represented the mass
            of the four basic elements - earth, air, fire, and water - from 
            which the university is created. (Theogony, )
        </p>
        <hr>

        <img src="../images/gaia.jpg" width="167" height="250">
        <p>
            Now turn our focus to Gaia. She was the representation of Earth,
            and fertility mother from Chaos. In the later stage, we would 
            discuss regarding the birth of Gaia with the topic of asexual 
            reproduction in Hesiod Theogony. Most importantly, Gaia was the 
            first deity who was recognized as female. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        
        <img src="../images/eros.jpeg" width="180" height="225">
        <p>
            Next, we would discuss Eros, who also was the descendant
            of the initial deity, Chaos. The deity represents the concept
            of <em>Love</em>, which will be essential 
            in later stages. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        
        <img src="../images/tartarus.jpeg" width="175" height="250">
        <p>
            Alas, we would look at Tartarus, who also was the descendant 
            of the initial deity, Chaos. The deity represents an inner part 
            of Earth, which placed very deep inside the Earth. The place was 
            designed to become the underworld of Earth, and served as a place 
            of punishment, which jails the individuals who commited severe 
            crimes or mistakes in the mythology. 
        </p>

        <h4>Uranus / Ouranos & Gaia </h4>
        <img src="../images/uranus.jpg" width="178" height="320">
        <p> 
            Talking about Uranus, he was the deity that represents the sky,
            lightning and thunder of the Earth. He was the descendant of 
            mother Earth, thus produced by Gaia. Gaia had produced Uranus 
            by her own, which was an example of asexual reproduction. Later, 
            Uranus and Gaia had married and gave birth to the twelve titans and
            the three Cyclopes and three Hecatoncheires. The twelve Titans in 
            the future would mate with each other, which is another evidence
            of incest among the deities, had gave birth to some of the most 
            important deities in the Greco-Roman mythology. Among all the 
            titans, two of the most important ones were Rhea and Cronus/Kronos.
            Beside the eighteen deities listed above, Uranus had also gave birth 
            to another deity, Aphrodite, born from the Uranus' genital. The 
            castration of Uranus was done by their children, Kronos, who was 
            intructed by his mother, Gaia.
        </p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <div>
        <h4>Rhea & Kronos</h4>
        <p>Rhea</p>
        <img src="../images/rhea.jpeg" width="150" height="216">
        <p>Kronos</p>
        <p> 
            Two of the Uranus and Gaia's children, had decided to mate 
            themselves together, but forgot to take measures to prevent 
            conception. Thus, when Rhea was about to gave birth to their 
            children, Kronos decided to eat their Children up. Why Kronos
            decided to eat up their children was because his behavior back 
            in the castration of his father. Kronos was afraid that their 
            children will do something similar that he had done before. Thus, 
            to prevent something like this happen in the future, Kronos
            decided to fundamentally solve the problem, by devouring 
            their children. <br> Nonetheless, Zeus and his sibling were still
            born in this world as their mother, Rhea, ambushed the children 
            on the Crete island and lied to his husband by giving Kronos
            clothes to eat. Thus, the children, the six major deity in 
            Greco-Roman mythology named as Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, 
            Hades, Hestia, Demeter, were born without harm from their father. 
            Eventually, Kronos did face the same fate as his father that Kronos
            was overthrown by Zeus and his siblings. 
        </p>

    <h3>The Twelve Olympians</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Zeus & Hera</h4>
        <img src="../images/zeus.png" width="150" height="212">
        <p>
            Zeus, god of storm and guardian of state and justice, after many 
            incidents, was elected as the leader between The Twelve Olympians.
            The most import attributes of the god were thunderbolts, 
            scepter and throne. The animal that represents Zeus was Eagle.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <img src="../images/hera.png" width="150" height="207">
        <p>
            Hera, god of childbirth and marriage, also as the first wife,
            were another important deity in the mythology. The attributes 
            of the goddess were polos, veil and next to Zeus. The animal 
            that represents Hera was Cow and Peacock. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two of the Rhea and Kronos's children, had decided to mate 
            themselves together, where most of the stories in the Hesiod 
            Theogony revolved around these two. Zeus had fought with his 
            father, and the Giants and Typhoeus, and punished Prometheus 
            for stealing fire for human kind. He had also sent Pandora as 
            the punishment to the mortals, by giving Pandora a box that
            contains all the evil and hope. The human kind had opened the 
            box as Zeus planned, and thus the punishment is done.

    <h2>Parthenogenesis in Hesiod's <em>Theogony</em></h2>

    <h3>The Difference in Male and Female - Parthenogenesis</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The ability of reproducing in Hesiod's Theogony was fairly 
            different between two genders. Even though we have examples 
            such as Aphrodite, and some other deities that were 
            born asexually, the birth of these deities would need an 
            external help. In other words, we could conclude that the 
            fathers could give birth to deities without sexual intercourse,
            but they would need some extra help from others.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Referring back to the examples given above, the birth of Aphrodite
            would need the intervention of Kronos and Gaia. Without Kronos 
            castrating his father, we would not know if Aphrodite would born 
            or not if this incident had not happened in the myth. Besides, 
            according to the myth, we would need Uranus's genital to mix 
            with the sea to give birth to Aphrodite.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, there were some exceptions and edge cases in the myth, 
            the birth of Athena from Zeus's head count as one. As in this 
            story, we have Athena, born from one of the organs from Zeus, 
            brain. However, we know that from the story, Athena, who we would 
            characterize as a 2D character before birth (HAHA ANIME WEEB), 
            was created by Metis before Zeus had produced her by himself. 
            Arguably, in modern concept, we would say that the holder of the
            intellectual property was Metis, which now altered her birth from 
            asexual to sexual as we have a mother role and a father role. 
            But from a physical aspect, she did come out of Zeus's head, so 
            we could also say it was asexually produced without external help.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, we can conclude that the male deities in the mythology would
            not enact single parent reproduction without any form of external 
            help, whether from another deity or another natural source. 
        </p>

    <h3>Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> - relationship with other myths</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            We had also discussed this in the class, and there were some 
            examples we could examine. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first one would be the Babylonian <em>Enuma Elis</em>, the 
            genesis in the Babylonian culture. In the myth, we have Apsu and 
            Tiamat, "merged" together and stored their offspring inside the 
            mother's body. Though the children later had caused many troubles
            and tagedies in the family, Tiamat still rejected to kill them 
            to avoid the future fate. Ea, one of their grandchildren, had 
            destined to kill his grandfather, Apsu, and eventually did kill 
            him. Thus, the other children decided avenge for Aspu's death, 
            and the mother Tiamat had asexually reproduce some monsters to 
            help the children to finish their task. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, Marduk, one of her children, fighted with her for 
            this avenge and won the battle. He then dissected her body 
            into two parts, which were the heaven and Earth according 
            to the myth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second one would be the <em>Kumarbi</em>. The myth is 
            a Hittite myth that also illustrated the castration of 
            Ouranos. The piece was especially important in multiple 
            aspects. The story in the myth was very valuable,
            as it was another literature from the Hittite culture. Also, 
            the content was valuable as it depicted a literature that was
            lost. Though the literature was written in Hittite language, 
            the names inside the literature has very little even none 
            connections to the culture. Some of the deities inside the 
            literature had connections with the Babylonian culture, and 
            most of the others had connections with the Hurrian culture. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the deities that the myth included in mind, we would 
            conclude that the myth was originally from the group of people
            who lived in the modern Turkey, around the north of Mesopotamia,
            and spoke a completely different language compared with the Hittites.
            Thus, the author concluded that the people spoke this language 
            had merged with the Hittites, which resulted in a assimilation of 
            their culture and the Hittite culture. The deities in the original 
            group of people were included in the Hittite culture. Hence, the 
            deities were recorded. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the original piece were lost as time passed. However, there 
            were still three parts that the Hurrian deities were included in the 
            piece. The saga appreas to be in three parts: 
            <em>The Struggle for the Kingship of Heaven, 
                The Song of Ullikummi</em> 
            and 
            <em>Kumarbi and the Hero of the Flood</em>. All of the three 
            sections of the myth were important, but I would be only 
            discussing the <em>The Song of Ullikummi</em>
            , as it was heavily related to the birth of Zeus. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A little synopsis of the section in the myth was the birth 
            of the Hittite version of Zeus birth. Kumarbi, in the story
            was the father of all deities, cursed the storm god. The 
            child Stone, was taken away from the goddess of childbirth, 
            and Kumarbi gave the Stone the name Ullikummi. Later, the 
            child Stone grows with incredible speed, and alas even as 
            high as heaven according to the myth. The speed of the child's 
            growth was astonishing, and worrisome. The gods, 
            namely the Storm-god and his sister Istar worried that the child
            may challenge them in the later stage (sounds familar isn't it?).
            However, both of them and the rest of the gods were all unable 
            to stop the growth of the stone. Alas, the gods went to find 
            Ea, the god of Wisdom, for help. In the end, Ea's method did 
            not work, and the child Stone had fought with the Storm-god 
            and defeated him, claimed himself as the king of the Gods. 
        </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Hera</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Now we should talk about the Parthenogenesis inside Theogony. 
            We had already introduced some of the most important deities 
            that performed this behavior in epic poetry. Thus, we can look 
            at the incidents and elaborate this incident towards the gender 
            role in ancient Greece. The practice reflected the conflict 
            and difference between genders and other factors that we could 
            still discuss at this date. The one example I will be discussing
            is Hera. Initially, Hera used this behavior to resist his 
            husband, Zeus. In the later stage, this behavior backfired as 
            this action enforced Zeus's reign at the Olympics. The nature 
            of this act in this circumstance illustrated the gender 
            difference and conflict, illustrating the harmonic and stable 
            relationship between deities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following content would contain many quotes from the second 
            source I use. The source is linked below at the end of the 
            webpage. Now I will be discussing Hesiod's Theogony and Hera.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the myths that we knew described ancient Greece, 
            we would have noticed that much of which does not have women 
            in the literature. Nonetheless, if the role of women existed, 
            the role was neglected to a large degree. 
            They would play non-major characters inside the epic. 
            We can also tell this trend or custom by looking at the role 
            assignment of opera in ancient Greece. None of the female 
            characters were cast by females; instead, a male would cast 
            the characters inside the plays.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, according to the author, one of the significances of 
            Hesiod's Theogony was the increased female participation in 
            the myth and the behavior they did to give birth to their 
            descendants. As we know, for reproduction, we would need males 
            and females to accomplish the task. In Hesiod's Theogony, 
            we would observe many examples of female individuals' 
            reproducing by themselves. These differences from the norm 
            showed an unparalleled relationship between the Theogony and 
            real-life back in Greece. Hesiod had used this method to 
            distinguish between ordinary human kinds and the deities. 
            Note that the content inside the Theogony does not equal 
            support towards feminists in today's content. Hesiod had 
            assigned the female deities various roles in the story. 
            Hera was the example of resistance against his husband but, 
            in the end, actually helped him to enforce his reign.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Hera's asexual reproduction is where various expressions converge. 
            The main reason behind her anger was the child Athena, who was born 
            from Zeus's head. The situation was interesting as we know Athena 
            was also asexually reproduced by Zeus. Zeus's wife believed her 
            husband cheated on her and decided to use the same method, 
            parthenogenetic, to express her rage. Before Hera had asexually 
            reproduced Hephaestus, she had already reproduced several children 
            for Zeus, namely Hebe, Ares, and Eileithyia. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Further, the weight given to the children inside the literature 
            was noticeable. The first generation, or the normal descendants 
            born with sexual intercourse between the couple, had got nearly 
            no descriptions inside the Theogony. In contrast, we have 
            Hephaestus, who was widely praised belong the deities for 
            his power of crafting and smithing.
        </p>
        <p>
            One nuance of the identity of Hephaestus in the Iliad and 
            Theogony is that Homer had acknowledged Hephaestus as the 
            child of Zeus <em>and</em> Hera. In comparison, Hesiod would 
            counter that argument and state that Hephaestus was the child 
            of Hera herself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another difference would be the characteristics of the deity 
            in the two different sources. Homer had depicted Hephaestus 
            as the one who hated Hera regarding his disability and low 
            status among the deities. On the other hand, Hesiod had 
            covered the negative characteristics of Hephaestus, 
            further changing his body from a monster to a disabled man. 
            The difference concluded that Hephaestus was not a monster, 
            and neither he nor his mother, Hera, suffered the same fate 
            as Tiamat and her descendants. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The resistance from Hera helped Zeus to enforce his reign as 
            Hera's child, Hephaestus's ability. As we mentioned before, 
            the gods praised the ability of crafts and smithing. 
            Thus, Zeus had employed Hephaestus's ability for his purpose. 
            Thus, Hephaestus had become an ally with Zeus, and he had 
            created the Pandora and the crown she wore.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Short Conclusion</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Inside the Hesiod's <em>Theogony</em>, there were many theogonic
            and cosmogonic thoughts that human should still think about. The 
            impact of the myths prolongedly affects the human generation 
            day by day. One could tell with so much artifacts and artistic 
            literatures that our predecessors produced throughout the human 
            history. With the influence of the myths, we could think about 
            the impact of the gist of the myth in the later eras. Especially
            with the gender role inside the myth, the topic is still discussed 
            at this date. With many different parties each represent a character
            inside the <em>Theogony</em>, we can find releveance and resemblence 
            in the myth and real life. Gender difference, in this situation of 
            reproduction, has showed a paradoxical result between the aim and 
            the results. All the deed that Hera done had become a support to 
            Zeus, and the quarrel, or difference became bigger. Thus, we could

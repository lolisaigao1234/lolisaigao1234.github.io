            "Another nice try, but it won't work", the Duke said. 
            The Duke used his sword to deflect the knife without 
            much effort. "Now its my turn. Give up and have a good rest."
            The Duke said without mercy, and swung his sword to you. 
            "Who knows", you said with severe panting.

            You know that after such a long fight, you do not have 
            the enough stamina to dodge the sword. The sword splited
            you into two parts, and no heal could be done.
